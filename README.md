# Nowarthuran Blog

## Overview

This project is a simple and modern blog website built using React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, and Vite. It aims to provide a clean and efficient platform for blogging with a focus on a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Features

React: The project utilizes the React library for building a dynamic and interactive user interface. React's component-based architecture allows for easy organization and maintenance of the code.

Tailwind CSS: The styling of the website is achieved using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-designed utility classes that make styling efficient and consistent.

Typescript: Typescript is employed to enhance the development experience by adding static typing to the JavaScript code. This helps catch errors during development and improves code readability.

Vite: Vite is used as the build tool for the project. It offers fast development server startup and efficient bundling, making the development process smooth and productive.
